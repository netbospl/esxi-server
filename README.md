# ESXi Server Skill

This repository contains an experimental ESXi Server Skill for agentic workflows. It documents how a human or AI operations agent should safely interact with a standalone VMware ESXi host using SSH, `esxcli`, `vim-cmd`, the vSphere REST API, datastore file transfers, and related read-only discovery paths.

The repository is documentation-only. It does not contain implementation code, dependencies, CI, credentials, hostnames, private IPs, passwords, tokens, or SSH keys.

## Safety-first operating model

1. Start with read-only discovery.
2. Probe capabilities before choosing REST, SSH, or SDK access.
3. Write a plan that names the target, risk, and rollback idea.
4. Wait for explicit human approval before state changes.
5. Verify after the change and summarize honestly.

Read [`SKILL.md`](SKILL.md) first for the exact workflow, approval rules, host-key guidance, and local-profile conventions.

## Why this repo exists

- It packages a reusable ESXi safety workflow for humans and agents.
- It keeps generic skill logic separate from host-specific data.
- It provides a sanitized example profile plus templates for change plans, approvals, rollback notes, and post-change summaries.
- It includes a small read-only discovery helper script and optional quality checks.

## Environment and local files

Use local environment variables or a secret manager. Do **not** commit real values to Git.

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ESXI_HOST` | ESXi hostname or address |
| `ESXI_USER` | Preferred ESXi user, ideally `agent` |
| `ESXI_PASS` | ESXi password when password auth is required |
| `ESXI_SSH_KEY` | Dedicated private SSH key path |
| `ESXI_KNOWN_HOSTS` | Dedicated SSH known-hosts file path |

Example placeholders live in [`profiles/example-host.md`](profiles/example-host.md) and [`.env.example`](.env.example). Local host profiles such as `profiles/*.local.md` and `HOST_PROFILE.local.md` are ignored by Git and may be loaded locally, but they must never be committed.

> **Warning:** never commit `.env`, private keys, API tokens, session IDs, private hostnames, private IP addresses, passwords, or screenshots/logs containing sensitive ESXi inventory details.

## Safe example commands

These examples are intentionally read-only.

Check that required variables are present without printing secrets:

```bash
: "${ESXI_HOST:?ESXI_HOST is required}"
: "${ESXI_USER:=agent}"
printf 'ESXi environment variables are set for host %s and user %s\n' "$ESXI_HOST" "$ESXI_USER"
```

Safe SSH pattern:

```bash
mkdir -p .ssh-known-hosts
ssh-keyscan -H "$ESXI_HOST" >> .ssh-known-hosts/esxi_known_hosts
ssh -i "$ESXI_SSH_KEY" \
  -o UserKnownHostsFile=.ssh-known-hosts/esxi_known_hosts \
  -o StrictHostKeyChecking=yes \
  "$ESXI_USER@$ESXI_HOST" 'esxcli system version get'
```

Create a REST API session:

```bash
SESSION=$(curl -sk -X POST \
  "https://$ESXI_HOST/api/session" \
  -u "$ESXI_USER:$ESXI_PASS" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" | tr -d '"')
```

List VMs through the REST API:

```bash
curl -sk "https://$ESXI_HOST/api/vcenter/vm" \
  -H "vmware-api-session-id: $SESSION"
```

## Choosing SSH vs REST API

Use the smallest, safest interface for the task.

| Task | Prefer |
|---|---|
| Host hardware, memory, NIC, vSwitch, VMkernel, or filesystem checks | SSH with `esxcli` |
| Standalone ESXi VM inspection when REST is insufficient | SSH with `vim-cmd` |
| VM listing, power state, lifecycle operations, and snapshots | REST API when available and reliable |
| Datastore browsing through HTTPS | REST/datastore browser endpoints |
| ISO, OVF, OVA, and VMDK upload/download | HTTPS datastore browser API, SCP, or `ovftool` where appropriate |
| Low-level network changes | SSH with `esxcli`, only after confirmation |

If a REST session returns `401`, re-authenticate rather than reusing stale session IDs. If capability detection fails, stop and report the failure instead of guessing.

## Dedicated agent user guidance

Prefer a dedicated local ESXi user named `agent` for automation. Use a dedicated SSH key stored outside the repository, and treat key creation, user creation, and permission changes as human-approved actions only. See [`references/dedicated-agent-user.md`](references/dedicated-agent-user.md).

## Additional checks and tooling

- [`Makefile`](Makefile) provides a `check` target that runs available quality checks without failing when optional tools are missing.
- [`scripts/esxi-readonly-discovery.sh`](scripts/esxi-readonly-discovery.sh) performs best-effort read-only discovery only.
- [`templates/`](templates/) contains structured prompts for plans, approvals, rollback notes, and summaries.

## Safety notes

- Prefer read-only discovery commands before write operations.
- Avoid destructive operations without explicit user confirmation.
- Show the exact command or API action before running dangerous operations.
- Check available RAM before VM creation, VM power-on, or memory increases.
- Check VM power state before hardware changes.
- Check datastore free space before ISO, OVF, OVA, VMDK, cloning, restore, or snapshot-heavy operations.
- Ask before deleting VMs, disks, snapshots, datastore contents, datastores, or networking objects.
- Ask before powering off, rebooting, suspending, or resetting production or unknown VMs.
- Use host-specific datastore and network names from a local profile, not from this generic skill.
- Do not hardcode credentials, session tokens, host details, private IPs, or private inventory names in examples or scripts.

## Maintenance notes

- Keep examples practical and safe by default.
- Keep ESXi 7.x compatibility in mind.
- Use placeholders for sensitive values.
- Keep host-specific facts in local profiles or local notes, not in the generic skill.
- Update this README and `docs/index.md` when adding or renaming reference files.
- Do not add package managers, frameworks, CI systems, or dependencies unless the repository grows beyond documentation.
- Validate new commands against a non-production ESXi host where possible.
